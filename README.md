To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine. Use the Git command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the Ruby and Rails dependencies. You can do this by running the setup script included in the project:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```
   This script will install the necessary Ruby gems, set up the database, and perform other initialization tasks as defined in the `bin/setup` file.

3. **Database Configuration**: Configure your database connection settings in `config/database.yml`. You might need to update the username, password, and other connection details to match your local PostgreSQL setup.

4. **Environment Variables**: Set up necessary environment variables. For example, if the application requires secret keys or database passwords, you should set them in your environment. Check `config/secrets.yml` and `config/database.yml` for placeholders that might need actual values.

5. **Start the Rails Server**: Once the setup is complete, you can start the Rails server by running:
   ```bash
   bin/rails server
   ```
   This will start the Puma web server on the default port (usually `3000`). You can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

6. **Run Tests**: To ensure everything is set up correctly, you can run the test suite with:
   ```bash
   bin/rails test
   ```
   This will execute the test cases defined in the `test` directory.

Remember to check the `.gitignore` file to understand which files and directories are excluded from version control. This can include configuration files with sensitive information, log files, temporary files, etc.

For any specific setup related to development, testing, or production environments, refer to the respective configuration files under `config/environments/
